Some ideas to investigate

- Calculate something similar to a (+/-) stat like in basketball for each O-Lineman to demonstrate individual impact on rushing and passing
  - Use this for predictive analysis on RBs, WRs, and QBs that are playing with a different group of linemen
- Does keeping the same group of linemen together from one season to another improve performance?  What about the skill positions + line?
- Look for patterns of injury given age, position, weight, 40 speed, etc.
  - What about number of snaps, historically?
  - Do previous injuries suggest future injuries?
- What does a growth/decline curve look like for each position in terms of fantasy point production vs age?
  - Do factors like weight, strength, 40 speed, etc.
