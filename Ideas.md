### Some ideas to investigate

#### Basic Viability

How effectively can future performance be predicted by past performance?  Create confidence intervals.  
See if accuracy can be improved upon by further analysis that accounts for things such as:
- Playing with new teammates, including linemen
- Likelihood of injury
- Adjusting expected performance based on experience and aging

#### Linemen

Calculate something similar to a (+/-) stat like in basketball for each O-Lineman to demonstrate individual impact on rushing and passing.
Use this for predictive analysis on RBs, WRs, and QBs that are playing with a different group of linemen

Does keeping the same group of linemen together from one season to another improve performance?  What about the skill positions + line?

#### Injuries

Look for patterns of injury given age, position, weight, 40 speed, etc.
- What about number of snaps, historically?
- Do previous injuries suggest future injuries?

#### Growth/Decline Curve

What does a growth/decline curve look like for each position in terms of fantasy point production vs age?
Do factors like prior injuries, weight, strength, 40 speed, etc. shift the curve?
