## Fantasy Football with R

How to run this program
- To run with sample data, simply clone this repo and run [Main.R](Main.R) (read documentation in that file first! you'll need to set a parameter or two)
- To run with the full data set, you will need to purchase this data first.  See below.

NOTE: the raw data inluded in this repo is licensed by Armchair Analysis.com under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 United States license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

This repo currently is working with a sample data set, using same data (week 17 and playoffs - 2015).  This is a smaller data set, and easier to work with while in development mode.  If you want to use the full 2000-2015 data set, you will need to purchase it [here](http://armchairanalysis.com/data.php).  If you purchase the full data set, it is expected that this data is unzipped and placed in the /data subdirectory (i.e. ./data/nfl_00-15)

1. The data was acquired from [Armchair Analysis](http://armchairanalysis.com/index.php).
2. You may download the zipped sample data directly from this [link](http://armchairanalysis.com/nfl_sample_data_2015.zip)

Currently this is a work in project.  The current TODO list is [here](https://github.com/KarlWenzel/Fantasy-Football/issues)

#### Results

Presently there is a [very basic predictive model for RBs](src/Base-Prediction-Confidence.md)
