##Fantasy Football with R

This repo currently is working with a sample data set, using weeks 1-8 of the 2012 NFL season.  This is a smaller data set, and easier to work with while in development mode.
Also included is a larger data set which spans the full 2000-2013 seasons.

NOTE: the raw data inluded in this repo is covered by the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/)

1. The data was acquired from [Armchair Analysis](http://www.armchairanalysis.com/index.php).
2. You may download the zipped sample data directly from this [link](http://www.armchairanalysis.com/NFLData_2012_WK1-8.zip)
3. Download their schema from [here](http://www.armchairanalysis.com/DataReference.pdf), (but it is included in the zip file too)

Along with the data, there is a small R script that will load some of the interesting data, although it does not do much else at this point.
